# Angular To-Do App

A simple yet powerful To-Do application built with Angular, showcasing key concepts like data binding, event handling, and task filtering.

---

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit tasks inline
- Delete tasks
- Filter by: All / Pending / Completed
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`

---

## Angular Concepts Used
This project covers:

1. Components – Structuring the app into reusable building blocks.
2. Interpolation (`{{ }}`) – Displaying dynamic values in the template.
3. Property Binding (`[property]`) – Binding component data to HTML attributes.
4. Class Binding (`[class]`) – Applying classes conditionally.
5. Style Binding (`[style]`) – Applying styles dynamically.
6. Event Binding (`(event)`) – Handling user actions like clicks and keypresses.
7. Template Reference Variables (`#var`) – Accessing DOM elements in templates.
8. Two-Way Binding (`[(ngModel)]`) – Syncing input fields with component data.
9. `*ngFor` Directive – Looping over tasks to render the list.
10. `*ngIf` Directive – Conditional rendering of elements.
11. Getter Properties – Automatically recalculating filtered lists (`filteredTasks`).
12. LocalStorage – Persisting tasks between page reloads.
